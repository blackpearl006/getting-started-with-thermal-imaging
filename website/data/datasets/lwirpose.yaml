            LWIRPOSE is a novel dataset that bridges the gap between RGB and Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) thermal
            imaging for 2D human pose estimation. It provides nearly aligned RGB-Thermal image pairs with
            comprehensive 2D human pose annotations, enabling research in cross-modal learning and multi-spectral
            pose estimation.

          text: |
            The dataset addresses the critical challenge of limited annotated thermal pose data by providing
            paired visible and thermal images. This pairing allows researchers to leverage knowledge from
            well-established RGB pose estimation models and transfer it to the thermal domain.
