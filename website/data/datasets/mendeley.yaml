            This recent breast thermography dataset represents a valuable contribution from Colombia,
            providing high-quality thermal images with pathologically validated diagnoses. The dataset
            follows the American Academy of Thermology (AAT) protocol for standardized image capture.

            Collected between 2021-2022 at San Juan de Dios Hospital in Cali, Colombia, this dataset
            addresses the critical scarcity of publicly available breast thermographic images. It has
            been used in state-of-the-art deep learning studies achieving over 97% accuracy in breast
            cancer classification.

    # Pathology Validation
    - type: "list"
      title: "Pathology Validation"
      description: |
        All diagnoses in this dataset are validated through pathology studies following biopsy procedures,
        providing high-confidence ground truth labels:
      items:
        - "**Malignant Pathology (PM):** 35 patients with carcinoma at various stages"
        - "**Benign Pathology (PB):** 84 patients with findings including collagenized stroma, fibroadenoma, cysts, adenosis, apocrine metaplasia, stromal fibrosis, epithelial hyperplasia, microcalcifications, and nodules"
        - "The comprehensive pathology classification makes this dataset particularly valuable for training models to distinguish between different types of breast abnormalities, not just binary normal/abnormal classification"

    # Limitations & Future Directions
    - type: "list"
      title: "Limitations & Future Directions"
      description: |
        **Limitations:**

        **Recommended Use Cases:**
        - Transfer learning from models trained on DMR-IR
        - Multi-view analysis research
        - Combined dataset studies with DMR-IR for increased diversity
        - Validation of models trained on other datasets
        - Benign vs. malignant classification research
      items:
        - "**Dataset Size:** Smaller than DMR-IR (119 vs 293 patients), may benefit from augmentation"
        - "**Camera Resolution:** 320×240 pixels lower than American Standard recommendation"
        - "**Geographic Diversity:** Single institution in Colombia, may not represent global populations"
        - "**Static Protocol:** Does not include dynamic cooling protocol like DMR-IR"
        - "**Demographic Details:** Limited demographic breakdown beyond age range"
