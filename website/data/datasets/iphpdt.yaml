    # Overview Section

        - type: "paragraph"
          text: |
            IPHPDT (Identity-Preserved Human Posture Detection in Thermal Images) is a large-scale infrared
            thermal dataset specifically designed for privacy-preserving human posture recognition. With
            approximately 75,000 images, it represents one of the largest publicly documented thermal datasets
            focused on activity recognition and posture classification.

        - type: "paragraph"
          text: |
            The dataset addresses critical privacy concerns in surveillance and monitoring systems by using
            thermal imaging, which naturally obscures facial features and personal identifying characteristics
            while maintaining the ability to recognize human postures and activities. This makes it particularly
            valuable for healthcare, elderly care, and smart home applications where privacy is paramount.

        - type: "highlight"
          text: |
            **Privacy Innovation:** Thermal imaging provides identity preservation by design -
            human subjects cannot be visually identified while their postures and movements remain clearly
            detectable, solving a critical ethical challenge in monitoring systems.

    # Four Posture Categories
    - type: "protocols"
      title: "Four Posture Categories"
      protocols:
        - title: "Standing"
          description: |
            Upright standing position with various arm positions and orientations. Includes
            natural standing variations, different body orientations relative to camera.

        - title: "Sitting"
          description: |
            Seated posture on various surfaces (chairs, floor, benches). Multiple sitting
            styles captured including upright sitting, relaxed sitting, and cross-legged.

        - title: "Lying"
          description: |
            Horizontal lying positions including supine (face-up), prone (face-down), and
            side-lying. Critical for fall detection and sleep monitoring applications.

        - title: "Bending"
          description: |
            Forward bending and crouching postures. Important for detecting falls in progress,
            picking up objects, and transitional movements between other postures.

    # Privacy-Preserving Features
    - type: "list"
      title: "Privacy-Preserving Features"
      description: "**Why Thermal Imaging for Privacy:**"
      items:

        - "**No Skin Tone:** Racial and ethnic characteristics are not captured"
        - "**Universal Heat Signature:** All humans appear similar thermally regardless of appearance"
        - "**Darkness Operation:** Works in complete darkness, allowing monitoring without intrusive lighting"
        - "**GDPR Compliant:** Inherently privacy-preserving, reducing regulatory concerns"
