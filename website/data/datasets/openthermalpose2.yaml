            OpenThermalPose2 is the extended version of the original OpenThermalPose dataset, featuring
            nearly double the data, subjects, and pose variations. It represents the most comprehensive
            open-source thermal human pose dataset available.

            **Major Expansion:** From 6,090 images to 11,391 images (+87%), from 31 to 170
            subjects (+448%), and from 14,315 to 21,125 instances (+48%).

      title: "Performance Improvements"
      description: |
        Models trained on OpenThermalPose2 consistently outperform those trained on the original dataset:

        The dataset now includes both YOLOv8-pose and YOLO11-pose baseline models, with TensorRT
        optimized versions for real-time deployment on NVIDIA Jetson devices.
      items:
        - "Better generalization to unseen scenarios"
        - "Improved accuracy on challenging poses"
        - "Enhanced multi-person tracking"
        - "Reduced false positives in cluttered scenes"

          **Recommended:** For new projects, use OpenThermalPose2 for better performance.
          The original OpenThermalPose is still valuable for comparison studies and when computational
          resources are limited.
