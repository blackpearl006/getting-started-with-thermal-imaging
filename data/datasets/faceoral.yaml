            This comprehensive dataset from PhysioNet provides thermal and visible facial images paired
            with oral temperature measurements from over 1,000 subjects. It was specifically designed for
            developing and validating automated temperature screening systems, particularly relevant for
            pandemic response, fever detection at entry points, and public health monitoring applications.

        - type: "paragraph"
          text: |
            The dataset addresses the critical need for non-contact temperature screening methods by providing
            ground truth oral temperature measurements alongside facial thermal and visible images. This
            pairing enables researchers to develop algorithms that can accurately predict core body temperature
            from facial thermal signatures, a crucial capability for high-throughput screening scenarios.

            **Critical Application:** This dataset became especially valuable during the
            COVID-19 pandemic for developing contactless fever screening systems at airports, hospitals,
            offices, and public venues. It provides the ground truth data necessary for validating
            thermal camera accuracy for health screening.

          **Important Note:** Thermal screening is a preliminary tool for identifying
          potentially febrile individuals. Positive thermal screens should be confirmed with
          clinical-grade thermometers. This dataset helps understand the correlation and limitations
          of thermal screening.
