            OpenThermalPose is a pioneering open-source thermal human pose estimation dataset that addresses
            critical challenges in computer vision, particularly insufficient illumination and privacy concerns
            that plague visible-domain pose estimation systems.

        - type: "paragraph"
          text: |
            The dataset was created by the Intelligent Systems and Signal Processing (IS2AI) Laboratory at
            Nazarbayev University, Kazakhstan. It provides comprehensive annotations following the MS COCO
            keypoint format, making it immediately compatible with existing pose estimation frameworks and models.
